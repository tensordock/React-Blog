**Select from our most popular VM configurations and deploy within seconds. TensorDock Instant VMs are meant to simplify
development, while cutting boot times to save you money.**

## Deploying Made Easier

We designed Instant VMs to maximize speed and reliability. Here's rundown on how we made it happen:

- **Unmatched Speeds:** Instant VMs bypasses most of the traditional deployment process. Rather than starting from
  scratch each time you hit deploy, we keep the most common configurations ready to access in seconds when needed.

- **Uncompromising Customization:** We're keeping what makes Virtual Machines great, while cutting out the fluff. Instant VM
  deployments still work with virtualy any Cloud-init script. However, our faster runtime allows for quick customization while
  without a lengthy reboot.

- **Unrivaled Reliability:** We deal with deployment problems so that you don't have to. Your Instant VM's hardware and
  software is tested and ready to go!

## API

We've set up two new API endpoints to make Instant VMs easy to use in your projects. The
[first](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20973002/2s8YzMYRDc#9a0c6985-1e5a-4a0a-ba6f-cec29312f85e) offers
a breakdown of all available Instant VMs.

```
curl --location 'https://marketplace.tensordock.com/api/v0/client/deploy/instantvms'
```

The [second](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20973002/2s8YzMYRDc#5ed7c116-35db-4966-8cf0-19d615638550) endpoint
allows you to deploy a specific Instant VM and customize the name, password, and cloud-init.

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://marketplace.tensordock.com/api/v0/client/deployinstant/single' \
--data-urlencode 'api_key=' \
--data-urlencode 'api_token=' \
--data-urlencode 'instance_uuid=5255d6ed-adaf-4356-90a9-d3b766dfc471' \
--data-urlencode 'name=My RTX 4000 Server' \
--data-urlencode 'password=superC0mplexPassword' \
--data-urlencode 'ssh_key=ssh-rsa AAAXB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDFtMHOaiM9LlNlG6lrtrF+....' \
--data-urlencode 'cloudinit_script=write_files:\n  - path: /home/user/cloudinit_website/index.html\n    permissions: '\''0777'\''\n    content: |\n      Woohoo!

```

## Get Started

Deploy an [Instant VM](https://dashboard.tensordock.com/deploy_preconfig) in just three clicks. We currently
have two configurations, with more on the way!

| GPU Model       | GPU Count | RAM    | Storage          | CPU cores |
| --------------- | --------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| H100 SXM5 80 GB | 1         | 112 GB | 1200 GB NVMe SSD | 22 vCPUs  |
| H100 SXM5 80 GB | 8         | 896 GB | 9600 GB NVMe SSD | 176 vCPUs |
|                 |           |        |                  |           |

All our preconfigured VMs run on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
