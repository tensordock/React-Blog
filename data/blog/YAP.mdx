# YAP: Your AI Pal

## TensorDock's New LLM Inference service

The TensorDock team is absolutely thrilled to announce the launch of YAP, our all-new LLM inference service. With OpenAI API support, you can integrate YAP seamlessly into your Python workflows.

## Using YAP

To get started with YAP, simply create a new OpenAI client in your Python library, set a dummy API key (more on this later), and set `base_url` to `https://yap.tensordock.com`.

For launch, YAP supports the latest Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model with a max 2048-token context length. Additional supported parameters are `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`. Note that we do not offer streaming support at the moment.

Here's an example program to help you get started:

```py
"""

"""
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key = "dummy",
    base_url="https://yap.tensordock.com"
)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {
            "role" : "system",
            "content" : "You are a pirate who speaks in pirate-speak."
        },
        {
            "role" : "user",
            "content" : "Explain LLMs to me in a single sentence."
        }
    ],
    max_tokens=256,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p = 0.7,
    frequency_penalty=1.0,
    seed = 17
)

output = completion.choices[0].message.content
print(output)
```

## Our Launch

At the time of writing, YAP is provided **free of charge** to help us test our infrastructure (hence, you may use a dummy API key); if you have any feedback (especially bugs), we'd love to hear from you in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Wrzqb4PH3t), or feel free to [email me](mailto:lance@tensordock.com). Please note that we're also running on fewer resources during our testing phase, so please be mindful of other users and limit your requests to a reasonable amount.

**Happy YAPping!**
